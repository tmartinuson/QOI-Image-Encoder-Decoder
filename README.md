# QOI-Image-Encoder-Decoder

##What is the problem?
PNG images take up too much space and in the modern day of machine learning this is definitely not tolerable. In comes QOI image compressions, which provides a fast lossless image compression from PNG to QOI that is 50x faster and that reduces the size of an image by ~20%.

##What is the something extra?
Our program will take a folder that contains several images and compress them asynchronously in batches to better suit machine learning pipelines.

##What did we learn from doing this?
(This should be written after you have done the work.)What is the bottom-line? Is functional programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
